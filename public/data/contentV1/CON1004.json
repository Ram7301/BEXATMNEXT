In this system, we have Categories, Assessment, Question Groups, and Questions, which are organized to evaluate employee competencies effectively. Administrators can assign employees to specific assessments, ensuring that only the relevant individuals participate in the evaluation process. This structured approach allows organizations to measure skills, knowledge, and performance accurately while managing the assessment workflow efficiently.",
